Day 1

Debugging my flutter project (Bloggy),it takes almost 3 hours, which was also a simple fullstack project which retrieves 
information from the spreadsheet and displayed in the app UI in the form of BlogCard. then started to build the actual main project,
unexpectedly ended the day with major build error.

quick review--

--Solve the issues in the Flutter app (Bloggy) and finally finish the app

--started the tutorial of making the project of AI-PDF-NOTES-TAKER in 11am

--configure the backend connection and authentication
for the project

--while configuring the backend, srw build error which was the result of version compatibility, 
Clerk and next.js version was mismatch 

--totally ended up thiz day with a major build error 



Day 2 

with a full of positive energy, tried to shortout the major build error, but i realise that it wont wont work,
so i delete the existing project and build the project again with latest configuration and change the REACT and 
REACT DOM verison to (REACT: "18" and REACT DOM:"18") and run the command npm install., this totally saves me, 
then i have sarted to build this project from the scratch. 

quick review--

--facing the major error that makes me to delete the entire project file

-- started from the scratch, and connect the convex db and clerk authentication, 

-- call both signIN & signUP page and customize it

-- ensured that all registered user data's are stored in the DB.
